# Albion University Network Design

This is a **Cisco Packet Tracer** project for designing the network of Albion University.

## Features:
- VLAN segmentation for different faculties
- RIP v2 routing for internal connectivity
- DHCP for dynamic IP allocation
- External email server with static routing

## How to Use:
1. Download the `.pkt` file
2. Open it in **Cisco Packet Tracer**
3. Test connectivity and configurations

# Albion University Network Design

This repository contains the **Cisco Packet Tracer** project for designing and prototyping the **network topology** for **Albion University**. The project aims to create a robust, scalable, and secure network infrastructure for the university's main and smaller campuses, covering various departments, student labs, faculty buildings, and external servers.

## üè´ **Project Overview**

Albion University has two campuses located 20 miles apart. The network design includes:
- **Main Campus**: 
  - Building A: Administrative offices, Faculty of Business
  - Building B: Faculty of Engineering/Computing and Art/Design
  - Building C: Student Labs, IT department, and internal servers
- **Smaller Campus**: Faculty of Health and Sciences, staff and student labs across different floors.

The network supports **VLANs**, **RIP v2** routing, **DHCP** for dynamic IP allocation, and a connection to an external email server hosted on the cloud.

## üåê **Network Design Features**
- **VLAN Segmentation**: Each faculty/department is assigned its own VLAN for efficient traffic management and security.
  - Building A: Admin staff & Faculty of Business
  - Building B: Faculty of Engineering/Computing & Art/Design
  - Building C: Student labs & IT Department
  - Smaller campus: Faculty of Health & Sciences
- **Routing**: 
  - **RIP v2** for dynamic internal routing
  - **Static routing** for external server communication
- **DHCP**: The administrative building and student labs acquire dynamic IP addresses from a router-based DHCP server.

## üñ•Ô∏è **Project Goals**
1. **Design and Plan** a scalable, secure, and reliable network for Albion University.
2. **Implement VLANs** for network segmentation to ensure traffic isolation and security.
3. **Set up Routing** using **RIP v2** and **static routing** for communication between the university‚Äôs internal and external servers.
4. **Provide end-to-end connectivity** and access to internal servers (e.g., university web server, email server).
5. **Configuration of Switches** with proper VLAN and security settings.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** (for network simulation)
- **Routing Protocol**: RIP v2
- **IP Addressing**: Subnetting for various departments/faculties
- **Network Components**: Routers, Switches, PCs, DHCP, Web & Email Servers, Cloud Integration
- **Security**: Basic VLAN security and ACL configurations

## üìÇ **Project Files**
- `Albion_University_Network.pkt` ‚Äì The Cisco Packet Tracer file containing the full network topology and configurations.

## üìë **How to Use**
1. Download the `.pkt` file from the repository.
2. Open the file using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
3. Verify network connectivity and ensure configurations are correct.
4. Test the communication between VLANs and the external email server.
5. Review the routing protocols and DHCP functionality.

## üìù **Evaluation**
The project includes:
- A report on the network design with an evaluation of:
  - **Performance**: How well the network handles traffic across multiple VLANs.
  - **Scalability**: Future-proofing the network for expansion (e.g., adding more departments).
  - **Reliability**: Ensuring minimal downtime with redundant configurations.
  - **Security**: Protecting against unauthorized access and ensuring VLAN isolation.
